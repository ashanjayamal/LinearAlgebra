Verify all assertions in Example Let \\(W\\) be the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) defined by \\[W = \\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \\in \\mathbb{R}^5 \\mid x_1 = 3x_2 \\text{ and } x_3 = 7x_4 \\}. \\] Find a basis of \\(W\\). Extend the basis in (a) to a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). Find a subspace\\(V\\)of\\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\)such that \\(\\mathbb{R}^5 = W \\oplus V\\). Answer: a. Let \\((x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)\\in U\\). Then \\(x_1=3x_2\\) and \\(x_3=7x_4\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align} (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) &amp;= (3x_2,x_2,7x_4,x_4,x_5)\\\\ &amp;=x_2(3,1,0,0,0)+x_4(0,0,7,1,0)+(0,0,0,0,1) \\end{align}\\] Let \\(v_1:=(3,1,0,0,0),v_2:=(0,0,7,1,0)\\) and \\(v_3:=(0,0,0,0,1)\\). Since \\(x_2,x_4,x_5\\in \\mathbb{R}\\),then \\[ \\text{span}(v_1,v_2,v_3)=U \\] Now, we need to show that \\(v_1,v_2,v_3\\) are linearly independent.Suppose that there exist \\(a_1,a_2,a_3\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that, \\[\\begin{align} a_1(3,1,0,0,0)+a_2(0,0,7,1,0)+a_3(0,0,0,0,1) &amp;=(0,0,0,0,0)\\\\ (3a_1,a_1,7a_2,a_2,a_3)&amp;=(0,0,0,0,0). \\end{align}\\] Thus, \\(a_1=a_2=a_3=0\\). Hence, \\(v_1,v_2,v_3\\) are linearly independent. Therefore, the list \\(v_1,v_2,v_3\\) is a basis of \\(U\\). Let \\(v_4:=(0,1,0,0,0)\\) and \\(v_5:=(0,0,1,0,0)\\). Claim 1: \\(\\text{span}(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5)=\\mathbb{R}^5\\). Let \\((y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5)\\in \\mathbb{R}^5\\). Then, \\[\\begin{align} (y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5) &amp;= (y_1,y_2+\\frac{y_1}{3}-\\frac{y_1}{3},y_3+7y_4-7y_4,y_4,y_5)\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{y_1}{3}(3,1,0,0,0)+y_4(0,0,7,1,0)+ y_5(0,0,0,0,1)+\\left(y_2-\\frac{y_1}{3}\\right)(0,1,0,0,0)+\\left(y_3-7y_4\\right) \\end{align}\\] Since \\(y_1,...,y_5\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), we have established that the list \\((3, 1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 7, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1),(0,1,0,0,0),(0,0,1,0,0)\\) spans \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) Claim 2: the list of vectors \\(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5\\) are linearly independent. Suppose that there exist \\(b_1,...,b_5\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[\\begin{align} b_1v_1+b_2v_2+b_3v_3+b_4v_4+b_5v_5 &amp;=0\\\\ b_1(3, 1, 0, 0, 0) + b_2(0, 0, 7, 1, 0) + b_3(0, 0, 0, 0, 1) + b_4(0, 1, 0, 0, 0) + b_5(0, 0, 1, 0, 0) &amp;= (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\\\\ (3b1, b1 + b4, 7b2 + b5, b2, b3) &amp;= (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). \\end{align}\\] This implies \\(b_1=b_2=b_3=b_4=b_5=0\\). Let \\(W\\) be the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) defined by \\[W = \\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \\in \\mathbb{R}^5 \\mid 6x_1 = x_2 \\text{ and } x_3 + 2x_4 + 3x_5 = 0\\}.\\] Find a basis of \\(W\\). Extend the basis in (a) to a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). Find a subspace \\(V\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) such that \\(\\mathbb{R}^5 = W \\oplus V\\). Suppose \\(V\\) is finite-dimensional and \\(U, W\\) are subspaces of \\(V\\) such that \\(V = U + W\\). Prove that there exists a basis of \\(V\\) consisting of vectors in \\(U \\cup W\\). Prove or give a counterexample: If \\(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\\) is a list in \\(P_3(\\mathbb{R})\\) such that none of the polynomials \\(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\\) has degree 2, then \\(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\\) is not a basis of \\(P_3(\\mathbb{R})\\). Suppose \\(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\) is a basis of \\(V\\). Prove that \\(v_1 + v_2, v_2 + v_3, v_3 + v_4, v_4\\) is also a basis of \\(V\\). Prove or give a counterexample: If \\(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) is a subspace of \\(V\\) such that \\(v_1, v_2 \\in W\\) and \\(v_3 \\notin W\\) and \\(v_4 \\notin W\\), then \\(v_1, v_2\\) is a basis of \\(W\\). Suppose \\(v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\) is a list of vectors in \\(V\\). For \\(i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\), let \\[w_i = v_1 + \\cdots + v_i.\\] Show that \\(v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) if and only if \\(w_1, \\ldots, w_n\\) is a basis of \\(V\\). Suppose \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) are subspaces of \\(V\\) such that \\(V = U \\oplus W\\). Suppose also that \\(u_1, \\ldots, u_m\\) is a basis of \\(U\\) and \\(w_1, \\ldots, w_n\\) is a basis of \\(W\\). Prove that \\(u_1, \\ldots, u_m, w_1, \\ldots, w_n\\) is a basis of \\(V\\). Suppose \\(V\\) is a real vector space. Show that if \\(v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) (as a real vector space), then \\(v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\) is also a basis of the complexification \\(V_{\\mathbb{C}}\\) (as a complex vector space). See Exercise 8 in Section 1B for the definition of the complexification \\(V_{\\mathbb{C}}\\).
