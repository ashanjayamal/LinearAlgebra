Show that \\((\\alpha + \\beta) + \\lambda = \\alpha + (\\beta + \\lambda)\\) for all \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Show that \\((\\alpha \\beta)\\lambda = \\alpha(\\beta \\lambda)\\) for all \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Show that \\(\\lambda(\\alpha + \\beta) = \\lambda\\alpha + \\lambda\\beta\\) for all \\(\\lambda, \\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Show that for every \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}\\), there exists a unique \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) such that \\(\\alpha + \\beta = 0\\). Show that for every \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) with \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\), there exists a unique \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) such that \\(\\alpha\\beta = 1\\). Show that \\(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3}i}{2}\\) is a cube root of 1 (meaning that its cube equals 1). Find two distinct square roots of \\(i\\). Find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^4\\) such that \\((4, -3, 1, 7) + 2x = (5, 9, -6, 8)\\). Explain why there does not exist \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) such that \\(\\lambda(2 - 3i, 5 + 4i, -6 + 7i) = (12 - 5i, 7 + 22i, -32 - 9i)\\).

Show that \\(1x = x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{F}_n\\). Show that \\(\\lambda(x + y) = \\lambda x + \\lambda y\\) for all \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and all \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}_n\\). Show that \\((a + b)x = ax + bx\\) for all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{F}_n\\). 2.2 Exercise 1B Prove that \\(−(−v) = v\\) for every \\(v\\in V\\). Solution: Let \\(v\\in V\\). Then there exist a unique additive inverse of \\(v\\). We denote it by \\(-v\\). Thus, \\\\[v+(-v)=0.\\\\\\] Then by definition, additive inverse of \\((-v)\\) is v. We denote it by \\(-(-v)=v\\). Suppose \\(a \\in \\mathbb{F} ,v\\in V\\), and \\(v= 0\\). Prove that \\(a=0\\) or \\(v=0\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a non-empty set. Let \\(V^S\\) denote the set of functions from \\(S\\) to \\(V\\). Define a natural addition and scalar multiplication on \\(V^S\\), and show that \\(V^S\\) is a vector space with these definitions. 2.3 Exercise 1C Statement 1: If \\(b\\in \\mathbb{F}\\), then \\\\[\\\\left\\\\{(x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3,x\\_4)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^4:x\\_3=5x\\_4+b\\\\right\\\\}\\\\\\] is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{F}^4\\) if and only if \\(b = 0\\). Proof of Statement 1 Statement 2 : The set of continuous real-valued functions on the interval \\(\\[0, 1\\]\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^\\[0,1\\]\\) Proof of statement 2: Statement 3 : The set of differentiable real-valued functions on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{R}}\\).
