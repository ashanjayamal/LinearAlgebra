Complex numbers comes when we can take square roots of negative numbers. The idea is to assume we have a square root of \\(âˆ’1\\), denoted by \\(i\\) that obeys the usual rules of arithmetic. Here are the formal defnition. Definition 1.1 (Complex Numbers ) A complex number is an ordered pair \\((x, y)\\), where \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), but we will write this as \\(x + yi\\). The set of all complex numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\): \\[\\mathbb{C} = \\{x + yi \\,|\\, x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}.\\] Addition and multiplication on \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) are defined by \\[(x + yi) + (u + vi) = (x + u) + (y + v)i,\\] \\[(x + yi)(u + vi) = (xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i;\\] here \\(x, y, u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) "],["ashan.html", "Chapter 2 Ashan", " Chapter 2 Ashan "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
