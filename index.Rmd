# Vector space
## $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$
We are already be familiar with basic properties of the set  of real numbers($\mathbb{R}$). Complex numbers comes when we can take square roots of negative numbers. The idea is to assume we have a square root of $âˆ’1$, denoted by $i$ that obeys the usual rules of arithmetic. Here are the formal defnition.

```{definition,name='Complex Numbers '}

- A complex number is an ordered pair $(x, y)$, where $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, but we will write this as $x + yi$.
- The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{C}$:
\[\mathbb{C} = \{x + yi \,|\, x, y \in \mathbb{R}\}.\]
- Addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{C}$ are defined by
\[(x + yi) + (u + vi) = (x + u) + (y + v)i,\]
\[(x + yi)(u + vi) = (xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i;\]
here $x, y, u, v \in \mathbb{R}$
