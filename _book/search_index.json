Complex numbers comes when we can take square roots of negative numbers. The idea is to assume we have a square root of \\(−1\\), denoted by \\(i\\) that obeys the usual rules of arithmetic. Here are the formal definition. Definition 1.1 (Complex Numbers ) A complex number is an ordered pair \\((x, y)\\), where \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), but we will write this as \\(x + yi\\). The set of all complex numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\): \\[\\mathbb{C} = \\{x + yi \\,|\\, x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}.\\] Addition and multiplication on \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) are defined by \\[(x + yi) + (u + vi) = (x + u) + (y + v)i,\\] \\[(x + yi)(u + vi) = (xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i;\\] here \\(x, y, u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) Fun Fact: The symbol \\(i\\) was first used to denote \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) by Leonard Euler in 1777. Note that \\(\\mathbb{C} \\supseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) because for all real numbers \\(a\\) \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), we can express it as a complex number by writing it as \\(a + 0i\\). We usually denote \\(0 + yi\\) simply as \\(yi\\), and \\(0 + 1i\\) as \\(i\\). The definition of multiplication for complex numbers is based on the assumption that \\(i^2 = -1\\). Using the standard arithmetic rules, we can derive the formula for the product of two complex numbers. This formula can then be used to confirm that \\(i^2\\) indeed equals \\(-1\\). Example 1.1 Let’s calculate the product of two complex numbers \\((1 + 2i)\\) and \\((3 + 4i)\\) using the distributive and commutative properties: \\[\\begin{align*} (1 + 2i)(3 + 4i) &amp;= 1 \\cdot (3 + 4i) + (2i)(3 + 4i) \\\\ &amp;= 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 4i + 2i \\cdot 3 + (2i)(4i) \\\\ &amp;= 3 + 4i + 6i - 8 \\\\ &amp;= -5 + 10i \\end{align*}\\] Proposition 1.1 (Properties of Complex Arithmetic) Commutativity: \\(z_1 + z_2 = z_2 + z_1\\) and \\(z_1z_2 = z_2z_1\\) for all \\(z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Associativity: \\((z_1 + z_2) + z_3 = z_1 + (z_2 + z_3)\\) and \\((z_1z_2)z_3 = z_1(z_2z_3)\\) for all \\(z_1, z_2, z_3 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Identities: \\(z + 0 = z\\) and \\(z1 = z\\) for all \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). Additive Inverse: For every \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}\\), there exists a unique \\(-z \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) such that \\(z + (-z) = 0\\). Multiplicative Inverse: For every \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) with \\(z \\neq 0\\), there exists a unique \\(z^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) such that \\(zz^{-1} = 1\\). Distributive Property: \\(z_1(z_2 + z_3) = z_1z_2 + z_1z_3\\) for all \\(z_1, z_2, z_3 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). The properties above are proved using the familiar properties of real numbers and the definitions of complex addition and multiplication. Here, we are going to prove that commutativity of complex addition and multiplication is proved. Proof. Addition : Let \\(z_1 = a + bi\\) and \\(z_2 = c + di\\) be any two complex numbers. Then we have: \\[z_1 + z_2 = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i = z_2 + z_1\\] This shows that addition is commutative for complex numbers. Multiplication: Again, let \\(z_1 = a + bi\\) and \\(z_2 = c + di\\) be any two complex numbers. Then we have: \\[z_1z_2 = (a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci - bd = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\\] and \\[z_2z_1 = (c + di)(a + bi) = ca + cbi + dai - db = (ca - db) + (da + cb)i\\] As you can see, \\((ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i = (ca - db) + (da + cb)i\\), which shows that multiplication is also commutative for complex numbers. So, we have proved that both addition and multiplication are commutative operations in the set of complex numbers. This means that the order in which complex numbers are added or multiplied does not affect the result. Definition 1.2 (Subtraction,Division) Let’s suppose \\(z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). The negative of a complex number \\(z_1\\) is denoted as \\(-z_1\\). It is the unique complex number such that \\[z_1 + (-z_1) = 0.\\] Subtraction in the set of complex numbers is defined as \\[z_1 - z_2 = z_1 + (-z_2).\\] For \\(z_1 \\neq 0\\), let \\(1/z_1\\) denote the multiplicative inverse of \\(z_1\\). Thus, \\(1/z_1\\) is the unique complex number such that \\[z_1(1/z_1) = 1.\\] For \\(z_1 \\neq 0\\), division by \\(z_1\\) is defined as \\[z_2/z_1 = z_2(1/z_1).\\] So that we can conveniently make definitions and prove theorems that apply to both real and complex numbers, we adopt the following notation. Notation :Throughout this note stands \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) for either \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or \\(\\mathbb{F}\\). The letter \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) is used because \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) are examples of what are called fields. Elements of \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) are called scalars. The word “scalar” (which is just a fancy word for “number”) is often used when we want to emphasize that an object is a number, as opposed to a vector (vectors will be defined soon). For \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(m\\) a positive integer, we define \\(\\alpha^m\\) to denote the product of \\(\\alpha\\) with itself \\(m\\) times: \\[\\alpha^m=\\underbrace{\\alpha\\cdot \\alpha \\cdots \\alpha}_{ m \\text{times}}\\]. This definition implies that \\[(\\alpha^m)^n=\\alpha^{mn}\\quad \\text {and} \\quad(\\alpha\\beta)^m=\\alpha^m\\beta^m\\] for all \\(\\alpha\\beta\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and all positive integers \\(m,n\\). 1.1.1 Lists Before defining \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\), we look at two important examples. Example 1.2 The set \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) , which you can think of as a plane, is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers: \\[\\mathbb{R}^2:=\\{(x,y):x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\] The set \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), which you can think of as ordinary space, is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers: \\[\\mathbb{R}^3:=\\{(x,y,z):x,y,z\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\] Let’s generalize this examples to higher dimensions. Definition 1.3 (List,Length) Suppose \\(n\\) is a nonnegative integer. A list of length \\(n\\) is an ordered collection of \\(n\\) elements (which might be numbers, other lists, or more abstract objects). Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order Note that many mathematicians call a list of length \\(n\\) an \\(n\\)-tuple. Lists are often written as elements separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses. Thus a list of length two is an ordered pair that might be written as \\((a,b)\\). A list of length three is an ordered triple that might be written as \\((x,y,z)\\) A list of length \\(n\\) might look like this: \\((z_1,...,z_n)\\) Sometimes we will use the word list without specifying its length. Remember, however, that by definition each list has a finite length that is a non-negative integer. Thus an object that looks like \\((x_1, x_2, ... )\\), which might be said to have infinite length, is not a list. A list of length 0 looks like this: \\((~)\\). We consider such an object to be a list so that some of our theorems will not have trivial exceptions. Lists differ from sets in two ways: in lists, order matters and repetitions have meaning; in sets, order and repetitions are irrelevant. Proposition 1.2 (Lists versus Sets) The lists \\((3, 5)\\) and \\((5, 3)\\) are not equal, but the sets \\(\\{3, 5\\}\\) and \\(\\{5, 3\\}\\) are equal. The lists \\((4, 4)\\) and \\((4, 4, 4)\\) are not equal (they do not have the same length), although the sets \\(\\{4, 4\\}\\) and \\(\\{4, 4, 4\\}\\) both equal the set \\(\\{4\\}\\). 1.1.2 Fn \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) Fix a positive integer \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) for the rest of this chapter. Definition 1.4 \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) is the set of all lists of length \\(n\\) of elements of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\): \\[\\mathbb{F}^n = \\{(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\mid x_i \\in \\mathbb{F} \\text{ for } i = 1, \\ldots, n\\}.\\] For \\((x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}^n\\) and \\(i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\), we say that \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th coordinate of \\((x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\). If \\(\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(n\\) equals \\(2\\) or \\(3\\), then the definition above of \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) agrees with our previous notions of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). Example 1.3 Let \\(\\mathbb{C}^4\\) be the set of all lists of four complex numbers: \\[\\mathbb{C}^4 = \\{(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) \\mid z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\}.\\] If \\(n \\geq 4\\), we cannot visualize \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) as a physical object. Similarly, \\(\\mathbb{C}^1\\) can be thought of as a plane, but for \\(n \\geq 2\\), the human brain cannot provide a full image of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). However, even if \\(n\\) is large, we can perform algebraic manipulations in \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\) as easily as in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) or \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). For example, addition in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is defined as follows. Definition 1.5 (addition of higer dimesionans) Addition in \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) is defined by adding corresponding coordinates:\\[ (a_1, …, a_n) + (b_1, …, b_n) = (a_1 + b_1, …, a_n + b_n) \\] Often the mathematics of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) becomes cleaner if we use a single letter to denote a list of \\(n\\) numbers, without explicitly writing the coordinates. For example, the next result is stated with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) even though the proof requires the more cumbersome notation of \\((x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\) and \\((y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\). Proposition 1.3 If \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}^n\\), then \\(a+b=b+a\\). Proof. Suppose \\(a = (a_1, …, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}^n\\) and \\(b = (b_1, …, b_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}^n\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray} a+b &amp;=&amp; (a_1,…,a_n) + (b_1,…,b_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; (a_1 + b_1, …, a_n + b_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; (b_1 + a_1, …, b_n + a_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; (b_1,…,b_n) + (a_1,…,a_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; b+a \\end{eqnarray}\\] where the second and fourth equalities above hold because of the definition of addition in \\(\\mathbb{F}^n\\) and the third equality holds because of the usual commutativity of addition in \\(\\mathbb{F}\\). 1.2 Definition of Vector space We will define a vector space to be a set \\(V\\)with an addition and a scalar multiplication on \\(V\\) that satisfy the properties in the paragraph above. Definition 1.6 (addition, scalar multiplication) An addition on set \\(V\\) is a function that assigns an element \\(u+v\\in V ~~~ u,v,\\in V\\) . A scalar multiplication on a set \\(V\\)is a function that assigns an element \\(\\lambda v \\in V\\) to each \\(\\lambda\\in F\\) and each \\(v \\in V\\) Now we are ready to give the formal definition of a vector space Definition 1.7 (Vector Space) A vector space is a set \\(V\\) along with an addition on \\(V\\) and a scalar multiplication on \\(V\\) such that the following properties hold. Commutativity: \\(u + v = v + u\\) for all \\(u, v \\in V\\). Associativity: \\((u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\\) and \\((ab)c = a(bc)\\) for all \\(u, v, w \\in V\\) and for all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}\\). Additive Identity: There exists an element \\(0 \\in V\\) such that \\(v + 0 = v\\) for all \\(v \\in V\\). Additive Inverse: For every \\(v \\in V\\), there exists \\(-v \\in V\\) such that \\(v + (-v) = 0\\). Multiplicative Identity: \\(1v = v\\) for all \\(v \\in V\\). Distributive Properties: \\(a(v + w) = av + aw\\) and \\((a + b)v = av + bv\\) for all \\(v, w \\in V\\) and all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}\\). The following geometric language sometimes aids our intuition. Definition 1.8 (Vector) Elements of a vector space are called vectors or points. Example 1.4 The simplest vector space is {0}, which contains only one point. The scalar multiplication in a vector space depends on \\(F\\). Thus when we need to be precise, we will say that \\(V\\) is a vector space over \\(F\\) instead of saying simply that \\(V\\) is a vector space. Example 1.5 \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\) is a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\). Usually the choice of \\(F\\) is either clear from the context or irrelevant. Thus we often assume that \\(F\\) is lurking in the background without specifically mentioning it. With the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication, \\(F^n\\) is a vector space over \\(F\\), as you should verify. The example of \\(F^n\\) motivated our definition of vector space. Example 1.6 \\(F^\\infty\\) is defined to be the set of all sequences of elements of \\(F\\): \\[F^\\infty = \\{(f_1, f_2, \\ldots) \\mid f_i \\in F \\text{ for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots\\}.\\] Addition and scalar multiplication on \\(F^\\infty\\) are defined as expected: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (f_1, f_2, \\ldots) + (g_1, g_2, \\ldots) &amp;=&amp; (f_1 + g_1, f_2 + g_2, \\ldots)\\\\ \\lambda(f_1, f_2, \\ldots) &amp;=&amp; (cf_1, cf_2, \\ldots). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] With these definitions, \\(F^\\infty\\) becomes a vector space over \\(F\\), as you should verify. The additive identity in this vector space is the sequence of all 0’s. Our next example of a vector space involves a set of functions. Notation:\\(F^S\\) If \\(S\\) is a set, then \\(F^S\\) denotes the set of functions from \\(S\\) to \\(F\\). For \\(f,g \\in F^S\\), the sum \\(f + g \\in F^S\\) is the function defined by \\((f + g)(s) = f(s) + g(s)\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). For \\(\\lambda \\in F\\) and \\(f \\in F^S\\), the product \\(\\lambda f \\in F^S\\) is the function defined by \\((\\lambda f)(s) = \\lambda f(s)\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). Remark: As an example of the notation above, if \\(S\\) is the interval \\([0, 1]\\) and \\(F=\\mathbb{R}\\), then \\(\\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}\\) is the set of real-valued functions on the interval [0, 1] The elements of the vector space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}\\) are real-valued functions on \\([0, 1]\\), not lists. In general, a vector space is an abstract entity whose elements might be lists, functions, or weird objects. Now let’s verify following example Example 1.7 \\(F^S\\) is a vector space If \\(S\\) is a nonempty set, then \\(F^S\\) (with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication as defined above) is a vector space over \\(F\\). The additive identity of \\(F^S\\) is the function \\(0 \\colon S \\rightarrow F\\) defined by \\(0(s) = 0\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). For \\(f \\in F^S\\), the additive inverse of \\(-f\\) is the function \\(-f \\colon S \\rightarrow F\\) defined by \\((-f)(s) = -f(s)\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). Proof. Let \\(S\\) be an set non empty set and let \\(f,g,h \\in \\mathbb{F}^S\\). Let \\(x\\in S\\). Let \\(a,b\\in \\mathbb{F}\\). Commutataive: \\([f+g](x)=f(x)+g(x)=g(x)+f(x)=[g+f](x)\\) . (Since \\(f(x),g(x)\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) have comutataive property.)Thus \\(f+g=g+f\\) for all \\(f,g\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) Associativity: \\([(f+g)+h](x)=(f(x)+g(x))+h(x)=f(x)+(g(x)+h(x))=[f+(g+h)](x)\\).(Since \\(f(x),g(x),h(x)\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) have associavity property.) \\([(a\\cdot b)\\cdot f](x)=(a\\cdot b)\\cdot (f(x))=a\\cdot (b\\cdot f(x))=[a\\cdot (b\\cdot f)](x)\\) (Since \\(f(x)a,b\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) have associavity property. Aadditive Identity: Let \\(0\\) be zero function \\(0 \\colon S \\rightarrow F\\) defined by \\(0(s) = 0\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). Then, \\([f+0](x)=f(x)+0(x)=f(x)+0=f(x)\\).Thus, \\(f+0=f\\) for all \\(f\\in F^S\\). Addtive Identity: For \\(f \\in F^S\\), the additive inverse of \\(-f\\) is the function \\(-f \\colon S \\rightarrow F\\) defined by \\((-f)(s) = -f(s)\\) for all \\(s \\in S\\). Then \\([f+(-f)](x)=f(x)+(-f)(x)=f(x)-f(x)=0=0(x)\\). Thus. \\(f+0=f\\), for all \\(f\\in F^S\\). Multiplicative Identity: \\([1\\cdot f](x)=1\\cdot(f(x))=f(x)\\). Thus, \\(1f=f\\) for all \\(f\\in F^S\\). Distributive Property: \\([a(f+g)](x)=a\\cdot ((f+g(x)))=a(f(x)+g(x))=af(x)+ag(x)=[af](x)+[ag](x)=[af+ag](x)\\).(Since \\(f(x),g(x),a\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) have distributive property. Thus, \\(a(f+g)=af+ag\\) for all \\(f,g\\in F^S\\) and \\(a\\in F\\). \\([(a+b)f](x)=(a+b)((f(x)))=a(f(x))+b(f(x))=[af](x)+[bf](x)=[af+bf](x)\\).(Since \\(f(x)a,b\\in \\mathbb{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{F}\\) have distributive property. Thus, \\((a+b)f=af+bf\\) for all \\(f\\in F^S\\) and \\(a,b\\in F\\) The vector space \\(F^n\\) is a special case of the vector space \\(F^S\\) because each \\((x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in F^n\\) can be thought of as a function \\(x\\) from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) to \\(F\\) by writing \\(x(k)\\) instead of \\(x_k\\) for the \\(k^{th}\\) coordinate of \\((x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\). In other words, we can think of \\(F^n\\) as \\(F^{\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}}\\). Similarly, we can think of \\(F^\\infty\\) as \\(F^{\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}}\\). Proposition 1.4 A vector space has a unique additive identity. Proof. Suppose \\(0\\) and \\(0&#39;\\) are both additive identities for some vector space \\(V\\). Then, \\[0′ = 0′ + 0 = 0 + 0′ = 0,\\] where the frst equality holds because \\(0\\) is an additive identity, the second equality comes from commutativity, and the third equality holds because \\(0′\\) is an additive identity. Thus \\(0 ′ = 0\\), proving that \\(V\\) has only one additive identity. Proposition 1.5 Every element in a vector space has a unique additive inverse. Proof. Suppose \\(V\\) is a vector space. Let \\(v \\in V\\). Suppose \\(w\\) and \\(w&#39;\\) are additive inverses of \\(v\\). Then \\[ w = w + 0 = w + (v + w&#39;) = (w + v) + w&#39; = 0 + w&#39; = w&#39;. \\] Thus \\(w = w&#39;\\), as desired. Notations: \\(-v\\), \\(w - v\\) Let \\(v \\in V\\). Then - \\(-v\\) denotes the additive inverse of \\(v\\); - \\(w - v\\) is defined to be \\(w + (-v)\\). ``` For the rest of this note, I will use follwoing noatation. Notations \\(V\\) denotes a vector space over \\(F\\). Proposition 1.6 \\[0v=0 \\text{ for all } v\\in V\\] \\(0\\) denotes a scalar (the number \\(0 \\in V\\)) on the left side of the equation and a vector (the additive identity of \\(V\\)) on the right side of the equation. Proof. Let \\(v\\in V\\). [0v = (0 + 0)v= 0v + 0v] Adding the additive inverse of \\(0v\\) to both sides of the equation above gives \\(0 =0v\\),as we want The result in proposition 1.6 involves the additive identity of \\(V\\) and scalar multiplication. The only part of the defnition of a vector space that connects vector addition and scalar multiplication is the distributive property. Thus the distributive property must be used in the proof of proposition 1.6.
